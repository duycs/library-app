# Share Library App 

### If you known about the Technology, that is which I use:
- Design a Library Management System
- Backend: Domain driven design and CQRS methodology, RPC and REST API style , .Net core, MySql database, CI/CD and cloud hosting.
- Frontend is this site: Angular 15, CircleCI deploy to AWS S3 serve file hosting.

### These are todo list which I will develop in the future:
- I develop functions base on ideas like as Goodreads social and ZLibrary share ebooks online
